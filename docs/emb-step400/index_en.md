## Electromagnetic brake

Some stepper motors are made with an electromagnetic brake built-in.
Typically, stepper motors have a holding torque which holds loads even
when stopped; however, when power is lost, the holding force is lost and
the suspended load will fall.

An electromagnetic brake is a device that locks the shaft of a motor and
only releases when the shaft is energized. In the event of a power
failure to the motor, the brake will immediately lock the shaft which
prevents the load from moving or falling. Vertically moving loads should
especially consider using one of these devices.

When using a stepper motor with an electromagnetic brake, it is
necessary to release/lock the brake depending on the status of the
motor. This brake add-on board is designed to be controlled in
conjunction with the STEP400 motor controller.
